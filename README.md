# Buggy Subgraph

You can use this subgraph to follow along this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDE2gQlhe6k "youtube video").

This is a buggy subgraph, and you can git clone it to follow along with the debugging process I explained in the video.
I have set up a local graph-node with docker compose.
